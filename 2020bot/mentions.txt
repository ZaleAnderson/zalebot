Hey Admin and Mods,

Today, we are excited to release our new **Rules Screening feature** to all communities. We all know that joining a new community can often be overwhelming and confusing. A great way to help set new members up for success is to outline a set of rules and guidelines that describe your community‚Äôs culture and how one should behave in it. 

Rules Screening gives you a simple, clean way to ensure that potential members can understand the guidelines for your community before joining, helping ensure that they can be positive additions to your community. **If enabled, new members will be prompted to read your rules when they join your server, and until they agree to them and pass your verification level requirements, they will not be able to talk, react, or DM other members.**

For servers that traditionally have not used gating mechanisms (e.g. bot role gate) know that enabling Rules Screening does create more friction to joining and **could lead to a decrease in new member joins.** However, it does offer the least friction possible for anyone who wants new members to agree to rules.

We also know communities often need more sophisticated screening methods like custom response/manual application, oAuth, and third party connections. We are hard at work building those so that we can release them to you soon as well. 

As always, please provide any feedback or comments on these new features so we can help improve them moving forward!

Happy Screening & Happy Holidays. 

_P.S. If you grant roles to new members on join via a bot, it will bypass this feature. We recommend updating your bot to only grant roles once members pass the screening. Look for the `pending` flag in our developer documentation._
_P.S.S If you plan to remove your bot role gate and use Screening, make sure you enable talking perms on @everyone so they can talk after passing. We've already ensured that pending members are not able to talk, dm, or react until they've accepted the rules._ || <@757659905015546039>
<@663587440929538058> if you're still talking about beatsaber, it has not been updated to support 90hz on quest 2. The only way to get it to run at 90 is to use the 90hz ADB command. Without that it defaultd to 72hz. The v23 patch only changed the home screen to 90hz and allows apps that have been updated by the dev up operate at 90hz. There's a growing list of games that have been updated but it's not nearly complete. || <@568678020387176461>

<@568678020387176461> people seem really intent on telling others how to use their products.

God rays are a result of the lens type but this community wide assumption that it means all lens have the same amount of rays or that oculus isn't targeting a specific level of quality confuses me || <@207615924570816513>

lol idiot? you were dismissive of a users sincere concern. 

``` idk if i have these "god rings" that some people seem to be having issues with its my first time using VR so i cant tell```  He wasn't "looking for them". He likely read about the issue and isnt experienced enough to know if he needs to be concerned. I promise, your answer didnt do anything to educate him. 

mostly because you dont know what his headset looks like or if he is "obsessing over" the issue. 

But you are right, I;m an idiot. Happy newyears, yay@!!! || <@207615924570816513>
<@!332182107034222613> , yes, I've tried all that... What I did was close one eye and get it looking good then close that eye and open the other.  It's very difficult to get it to look good in both eyes, but I can do it with it between 1 and 2 on the IPD display.  The issue is the edge blurring which like you've said, seems normal but is very annoying. || <@198579561342959616>
