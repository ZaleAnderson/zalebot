whats up with this? || <@207615924570816513>
You'd want a 5gbps cable and 5+ meters (depending on play space) and those aren't that cheap afaik, but "no cable" was the main reason why I got the quest so it was a no brainer for me to get VD || <@196992876029280257>

Anyone that knows what is happening? || <@347765560240504833>
Any usb 3 cable is 5+ gbps, just like the oculus link, but not any usb-c is usb 3, point being you don't want usb 2 which limits you to 480 mbps, and you probably want more than 3 meters which is where most usb 3 cables end due to specification due to hardware restrictions, which is why usb 3 cables with a length longer than 3 meters are rare and expensive, which is why I said I don't think you will find those for 10-15 bucks, you be looking at 3 meters or at usb 2 cables || <@196992876029280257>

I did say that if you already have a good enough router VD is the better and cheaper option, it's not gonna be cheaper if you still have to buy a router, unless you compare it to the official link cable at which point the router + VD is still cheaper, anyway wireless is always the better option here regardless || <@196992876029280257>

How's your latency on link vs VD then? || <@196992876029280257>
when motion to photon would probably be identical || <@428659951175467010>
even in the performance overlay, it only shows those || <@428659951175467010>

Hi all, apologies if this is in the faq and not clear or I somehow missed it, but is it possible to pirate oculus games and run them in revive on a non-oculus pc headset?

How the hell do I even sideload shit? || <@502364179127205888>
Rookies sideloader downloads, is it for oculus only? Quest 2 arrives tmrw so jus need to figure out what I can / cant use, I've seen the spreadsheet, so does that mean I jus have to test the games and they'll likely work? || <@477051435020976128>

<@!196992876029280257> i aint strapping shit, why would i add weight || <@787042772016037928>
the whole vr headset upgrades are not just to make it more powerful but also weight less || <@787042772016037928>
dont why some people do that, like jeez just put it in your pocket || <@787042772016037928>
people who think front is heavy is those who dont have optimal strap || <@787042772016037928>
or dont know how to adjust it || <@787042772016037928>
bro it fucking is front heavy thats how it works, there is more weght in the front than the back || <@616447276616908811>
with nothing to show for it || <@428659951175467010>
also, nobody even asked for your opinion in the first place, he just showed his setup || <@428659951175467010>
what strap u have || <@787042772016037928>
what mods on it || <@787042772016037928>
the point isnt what accessories do i have its that it is front heavy || <@616447276616908811>
with the band it rest on the top of your head, and your top head can take ton of pressure thats why it works || <@787042772016037928>
The controller showed on steamVR are the oculus one too btw || <@235133534761779200>
I have virtual desktop all working and I have installed the patch, how can I run exe files on my computer, beat saber for instance, it wont full screen on my headset || <@127541598945804288>
Btw the Steam menu in game show that i use Oculus Touch soo :/ || <@235133534761779200>
there's a reason why the Quest was always labelled as "front heavy" and not just "heavy" || <@581337844220690432>
thats where the top bandana comes in || <@787042772016037928>
anyone know how to download a game off of the gui || <@578557327452667915>
dunno what the "top bandana" is, but the headset and strap in theory could be double the weight and still be relatively comfortable for most people if it were balanced || <@581337844220690432>
I only have experience with halo with PSVR which doesn't have as heavy of a screen || <@581337844220690432>
but then i was like well since the band is what does the magic i dont need the halo, i tested both back to back many times then decided to use the modded default strap || <@787042772016037928>
the only reason why I didn't get a halo strap for my Q2 is because the major con for me with the halo strap is that it left my hair greasy after a play session || <@581337844220690432>

Alright, something really weird happened. I accidentally yanked my headphones out of my quest 2, but they were fine. I tested them on my phone and they play music out of both ears and everything. Anytime I use them in the quest now, however, it only plays out of the left ear. I have tested this on other earphones as well, same result; it must be a software issue in the Quest 2 that's just screwed up now. I can also tell you that I _know_ it's a software issue because I tried rebooting and it plays the startup sound normally out of both headphone ears for a second, and then right in the middle of the chime it goes back to just the left ear. || <@241002671660597248>
Which way did you yank it || <@258027565363625984>
That's always why you play with some sort of cable golder || <@258027565363625984>

Anyway I don't think piracy is anything that needs to be promoted, people that can afford software should pay for it, devs need money too and they're not gonna bring you new content without getting paid, people that can't afford it will check and see if piracy is possible, so yeah, no need to promote it. There's also the small possibility that if Facebook realizes how much piracy is going on, they might put a stop to that, another reason why you shouldn't promote it to people that aren't interested in it || <@196992876029280257>

either try applying the crack again or reinstall from the beginner. whitelist or put that game folder in your exception list in your antivirus so it doesn't pick it up when you start the game. || <@379516855687315466>

Hey Admin and Mods,

Today, we are excited to release our new **Rules Screening feature** to all communities. We all know that joining a new community can often be overwhelming and confusing. A great way to help set new members up for success is to outline a set of rules and guidelines that describe your community’s culture and how one should behave in it. 

Rules Screening gives you a simple, clean way to ensure that potential members can understand the guidelines for your community before joining, helping ensure that they can be positive additions to your community. **If enabled, new members will be prompted to read your rules when they join your server, and until they agree to them and pass your verification level requirements, they will not be able to talk, react, or DM other members.**

For servers that traditionally have not used gating mechanisms (e.g. bot role gate) know that enabling Rules Screening does create more friction to joining and **could lead to a decrease in new member joins.** However, it does offer the least friction possible for anyone who wants new members to agree to rules.

We also know communities often need more sophisticated screening methods like custom response/manual application, oAuth, and third party connections. We are hard at work building those so that we can release them to you soon as well. 

As always, please provide any feedback or comments on these new features so we can help improve them moving forward!

Happy Screening & Happy Holidays. 

_P.S. If you grant roles to new members on join via a bot, it will bypass this feature. We recommend updating your bot to only grant roles once members pass the screening. Look for the `pending` flag in our developer documentation._
_P.S.S If you plan to remove your bot role gate and use Screening, make sure you enable talking perms on @everyone so they can talk after passing. We've already ensured that pending members are not able to talk, dm, or react until they've accepted the rules._ || <@757659905015546039>

I have an issue generally getting rookie's sideloader to launch at all. When i start it nothing happens, theres just an AndroidSideloader.exe running in Task Manager, but it doesnt do anything. I have an exceptioon for the file itself aswell as the whole folder in windows defender. I've tried running it as admin aswell as in  several compatibility modes, just doesnt do anything. Rclone GUI works just fine, so i could just manually install the apk's via sidequest, which is working just fine || <@331857648976920578>

so i used rookies to download beat saber, just curious how to add custom songs, thanks. || <@603204884430585860>
it depends if you constitute what they offer as "songs" || <@581337844220690432>
for what || <@428659951175467010>
<@663587440929538058> "all of which will support 90Hz in the near future" || <@207615924570816513>
Hi all, I was wondering, I installed quest 2 v23 and I can't find out how to play games at 90hz, OVR metrics is telling me that my games are still running at 72hz. Are all games compatible ? Do i need to update my games ? Can you give me an example of game running at 90hz for me to try ? Thanks || <@115171174350192641>
which I still use because I'm not on v23 yet || <@581337844220690432>
i can tell^^ im not on a remote session or anything, just regular windows session. Where can i find the logs in the sideloaders folder so i can check them || <@331857648976920578>
Wait, what is the final verdict. Does official bs run in 90hz because I only see people saying in does but I see no info online about it. Only people talking about the v23 update and how it will benefit beat saber || <@207615924570816513>

The game decides to run at what settings it needs || <@258027565363625984>
So both quest 1 and 2 download essentially the same version untill you start up the game and it realizes what headset you’re on? || <@270635374156447744>
Why would it have alpha next to it though? || <@270635374156447744>
Not sure what you are referring to || <@258027565363625984>

hey, i have downloaded rookie and my quest connects to it fine, then i choose my game and download/ install it but when i look in my quest the game is not in my library. i have tried multiple times. || <@335269541615763457>

um, why are you running command line?  rclonebrowser is a GUI app that uses the command line internally, we distribute that.  It is user friendly, please grab and use that, you only need to unzip and run "rclonebrowser.exe" || <@260240834174255106>
why? || <@547517002755997697>
verify rookie says "Success" after the install.  If not, you can look at the logs.  Often the problem is you already have the app installed.  Provide details on which game and that can help || <@260240834174255106>

The base game / demo is free, but then there's a "Time Boat" adventure that is DLC.

I'm guessing the old version included the Time Boat DLC, but I understand the whole structure of the game has changed drastically since then || <@133090911587532800>

that's not why your games appeared my guy || <@428659951175467010>
what piracy || <@319955432099676160>
and if it does, once I startup the rookie sideloader how do I  proceed from there || <@127919163468546048>
what if the games arent showing up on my quest, did I do something wrong? || <@127919163468546048>
what if the games arent showing up on my quest, did I do something wrong? || <@127919163468546048>
not sure what VR its designed for, but was hoping i could conver it || <@83276280564285440>
hmm for me they just run into windowed mode when i do that || <@610532805293768705>
By right clicking the icon of vd in the taskbar "running services" thingy or whatever || <@152842840991465475>
yeah tried to load it with the vd windows app (launch app or whatever from the taskbar) but no luck || <@610532805293768705>
I have like 5 members of family who come and I install 50gb worth of games || <@634498484828897305>
What game isn’t working? || <@196712556880986113>
anyone know how to run asgard's wrath wirelessly on pcvr and quest 2, I can only get it to work with the link cable if I try without I get this: || <@610532805293768705>
how big is resillio quest? || <@634498484828897305>
How does resilio work with bulk installing then? || <@634498484828897305>
You then install them using whatever method you want || <@189778046801149952>
I don't think you understand how much work that would be || <@260240834174255106>
how do you sideload a game it it has an obb || <@634498484828897305>
What difference would that make though? || <@152842840991465475>
You said piracy server.  We don't host too many PCVR games.  And we have a lot of data.  If you want a discussion server then I don't know what you're talking about, can discuss it here || <@260240834174255106>
what does this mean? || <@474581646641856519>
sorry if this is a stupid question, but where can I get the apks to manually download the games? || <@420868740519952391>
but there's no success which is weird || <@428659951175467010>
hey guys, hope you can help me. I have an amd r390 gpu and i know it is official not supported. But I cant even get oculus link working. The windows app is showing my quest 2 as connected but i do not get the connection inside the quest. Any idears? || <@253217632327696386>
I think the only way you would be able to play pcvr games on your device is trying out VD,ALVR or something like that but i am not sure what kind of performance you would be getting. || <@152842840991465475>
Im not planning to play on pc right now, just testing things out. It was just that i cant get the oculus link show up within the headset and i was curios if this is because of the gpu or something else. DNS block or telemetry disabled perhaps || <@253217632327696386>
Hey ! i have some problem when i click to install the game || <@376761265475026947>
When i click i get a strange error || <@376761265475026947>
what i can do || <@376761265475026947>
So, I know you gotta join the telegram to get VRP Essentials (I have read faq). But I got signed out of my account and since I used a random ass phone number becauseI dont have one I cant sign in. Can someone send it through my DMs for me or do I just have to suck it and use Telegram if I ever do somehow find a phone number that isnt banned on a second phone number app because im iPad gang? || <@659573476402790422>

What's stopping you from using a different random number || <@365593459236667393>
Can you specify why a burner number didnt work? || <@365593459236667393>
not sure how obb works if they require them though || <@634498484828897305>
how likely are you able to get banned using pirated games on quest? <@331843144520040458> || <@690556137057157161>
So if I did the work-around where I'm using a oculus dev account instead of facebook, am I at risk? || <@198579561342959616>
i got a warning when i logged into the dev site saying that oculus accounts will be discontinued in jan 2023 || <@690556137057157161>
I...didn't tell you that you got banned.  I repeated what **you** said || <@260240834174255106>
sad there are like no cracked copies anywhere || <@349260016169254915>
What do you mean updates? || <@198579561342959616>
<@198579561342959616> probably the USB port. The cable that comes with the quest is kinda nice. I used it for link when i absolutely didnt have another cable with me || <@319955432099676160>
and in device manager tree it shows its connected to a usb3 hub || <@198579561342959616>
Discord has a search function. This server has a FAQ. I don't know why we keep seeing this same question 10 times every day. || <@332182107034222613>
Was wondering, Does anyone have a old demo ver of Epic Roller Coasters v426?, It seems the demo got updated where "Alternative Server" got removed, so we're unable to add the crack ver to the new demo ver. || <@101138153083006976>
who's "we" || <@260240834174255106>
trust you saw these...but I didn't pull what I assume to be versionCode for them || <@260240834174255106>
For asking how to add torrent game to games tab. || <@424570546093555713>
So anyone knows how ? || <@424570546093555713>
I don't know what you are referring to || <@260240834174255106>
Flow: make sure to get the free app Epic Roller Coasters from Quest store, then uninstall it first before installing the DLC patched version. When downloading DLC, press cancel, then press "Alternative Server" to download from AWS servers. || <@101138153083006976>
please show me the demo, you are just showing DLC in the game already || <@260240834174255106>
well fuck me, what do I know || <@260240834174255106>
you know what || <@101138153083006976>
when that day comes, please think again about saying that, and instead complete all the manual install steps || <@260240834174255106>
rookie loader is why easy to use lol less headache || <@101138153083006976>

i mean oculus app, shows my quest 2 in there || <@198579561342959616>
Yeah. I have the Oculus desktop app installed. When I plug my headset into the USB it asks if I can't to connect to Link. || <@332182107034222613>
not sure why i cant see || <@198579561342959616>
ahh yeah that would probably be why || <@482771554237808640>
im not sure what the other guy is on about || <@428659951175467010>
well, that's why it doesnt work haha || <@198579561342959616>

I'm keeping Bigscreen installed because of the other stuff it can do, like joining rooms where other people are watching stuff. But I'll stick with Skybox for 3d movies from my own PC. || <@332182107034222613>
right...but the whole purpose of plex is to share the server out || <@260240834174255106>
you're supposed to do it quickly, or gingerly, or whatever - I have no idea I don't really have a need to play horror games in VR || <@260240834174255106>
it comes down to personal preference, the pu leather ones hold a little bit more sweat, whereas the silicone ones will have it running straight down your face immediately. The Pu leather ones can be a bit more comfortable(depending on your strap) but unless you are using a thicker one then I would say only marginally || <@581337844220690432>

Once again, two options. Create an apk that could use our own protocol which would be harder to make but easier to work with, or reverse engineer Link which would be easier to do but harder to work with || <@311631997674061825>
Which one? || <@311631997674061825>
Looks like the "oculus-driver" is an EXE file instead of a dll which is not good || <@311631997674061825>
either i need some way to decompile it OR i could use a usb-sniffer of some kind which would be unfun || <@311631997674061825>
if I get lucky the driver is written in .net and I can just extract code from it which would be illegal but who cares lmao || <@311631997674061825>

Guess what I got lucky || <@311631997674061825>
Looks like I can extract the driver because it's a .net, however I can't make heads or tails of it because I do not know c# or .net || <@311631997674061825>
figured I'd ask here, even if it's unrelated to piracy, since this place is more related to the underbelly of VR than anywhere else I could find || <@172477064828420096>

New version of rookie will be coming where spoof will have value, but, only to run 2 copies of the same game. It is no longer valuable for " hiding"     from telegram post || <@465232992147603468>

The best meth ever hands down was that applesauce shit. We called it cat piss.. ever since the gov outlawed pseudoephedrine nobody can make it. A line of that crap would make a person jizz their boxers.
there was a cook in long beach cali that supplied all of the south bay. He died and the shit  dissapeared. Ask any biker or junkie and OG banger in LA they will tell great shit about cat piss
James Benz well since your being honest I will be too. The old school meth before the 2003 or so was so good that you didn't need mdma or other shit to transport you to the moon. This shit was bomb. It wasnt speedy although it made you stay up. This stuff triggered such a huge dopamine rush that it made a person jaw drop and sink in their chair.
I'm 41 and I've lived in the drug underground a long long time. So if I take things literal its because I dont fuck around.
I'm a chill dude and goofy but when it comes to dealing with people in the street or about drugs I'm dead serious.
Kenneth Fresno people get killed or even "disappeared" if you fuck around in the drug underworld. I lived in los angeles.. you know what homies used to do to people we didn't want   around? They would smoke them out and get high with them, then give them a shot of heroine and kill them and take their car. Parent be asking and cops but all the homies would say is "hey he overdoes he did it himself" see how dark this shit gets?
sometimes they take the dude to Mexico and he stays there stuck

So i'm sure we all know and mostly don't care (but you should!) that Average game VR RIFT 'Marvels Powers Disband' has been discontinued and FUCK FB for this and no refunds despite it being like 50 game and 2 years old LOL  Presumably this is due to the licence and some bs scam theyll have been running back in 2018.  We should care because they're taking a game some of us bought and effectively removing our access to it which was bad on PC but disgusting on VR. And  is likely illegal especially as it came with rift so you may have bought it for that game etc.  I believe the legality is unproven in court (despite their shitty FB polices which dont supersede law).  My comment is 1) be aware that FB is now pulling this live service no games are safe bs and if a game doesnt have offline ...then its likely a scam waiting to be canned. 2) Is there any mods out there for bots to keep it going?  For those who paid and still enjoy it and its not the worse game and should exist for those who like it imo. And there is no other marvel games like it in VR.  Any thoughts ? || <@695603955761414154>

the 2013 ea case shows that despite you being correct (though its fluid and new judgments can change this and dependent on the country) that gamers can sue and win and have a right to if they feel they have not had their moneys worth. This has been done and shown to carry weight in court and ofcourse we only have steam refunds because of court cases.  Beyond this it is WRONG and and right and wrong matter especially after the latest cyberpunk debacle .  I AM DELUSIONAL as i do believe that it is a legal grey area (as said in my comment) and look at the Electronic Frontier Foundation case and the changes that made via the library of congress in regards to what is possible post shut down.  This is still all very much untested and evolving.  BUT anyone who thinks its ok to sell a AAA priced game and a year later deny access without a refund offer IS DELUSIONAL.  But thank you for your opinion as it is us the gamers who suffer but it will ultimately be the courts and the law of each land which decide the fates of these and all games. || <@695603955761414154>

lol idiot? you were dismissive of a users sincere concern. 

``` idk if i have these "god rings" that some people seem to be having issues with its my first time using VR so i cant tell```  He wasn't "looking for them". He likely read about the issue and isnt experienced enough to know if he needs to be concerned. I promise, your answer didnt do anything to educate him. 

mostly because you dont know what his headset looks like or if he is "obsessing over" the issue. 

But you are right, I;m an idiot. Happy newyears, yay@!!! || <@207615924570816513>

whenever i try tospoof with rookie's it just crashes || <@242107857212932099>
when you download them with rclone  they should stay on your drive || <@242107857212932099>
its essentially if your eyes are straight ahead and you are exactly facing what you see, its fine, if you use any bit of peripheral it's blurry, thats what im experiencing. || <@198579561342959616>
Try adjusting the IPD and also how high/low it's sitting on your face, how tight it is around your head || <@332182107034222613>

<@!332182107034222613> , yes, I've tried all that... What I did was close one eye and get it looking good then close that eye and open the other.  It's very difficult to get it to look good in both eyes, but I can do it with it between 1 and 2 on the IPD display.  The issue is the edge blurring which like you've said, seems normal but is very annoying. || <@198579561342959616>

Anyone know how to fix that oculus Q1 update loop? || <@609145798378258442>
I think by now it's fair to say that the lenses vary from batch to batch. I have also had similar issues and it's not really anything to do with IPD, because I can get it clear in the dead centre but the sweet spot is tiny. I bought mine off Amazon, so they will send me a new unit when they are back in stock and I just put up with it in the time being || <@581337844220690432>

Can someone explain why the "virtual desktop batmaker" exists? Never had a issue with just launching the exe and having the game show up correctly. What is its purpose? || <@152842840991465475>

every other game shows up || <@676122055250280509>
essentially: the batmaker makes bats to launch the program against the VDL streamer exe, I asked ggodin(VD Dev) why this fixes certain compatibility issues, ranging from Vive controllers in TWD to no display on games like KF: Incursion, the reason is because the Inject/Launch function in VD uses Oculus runtimes due to legality reasons, in essence. || <@201258476750635008>
When using batmaker to make oculus link shortcuts, it is just a glorified "argument adder" || <@201258476750635008>
<@!258027565363625984> in the future if anyone asks what VDL is please point them to this. || <@201258476750635008>
<@!258027565363625984> please link anyone who asks about VDL to this post, thanks. || <@201258476750635008>
rookie is having me compile a more recent version where he addressed the issue, so stay tuned, I will also make the menus more descriptive, then on telegram both the standalone and VRP essentials will be updated, but the VRP essentials version will come with the custom spoofer, along with the required runtimes added to PATH environment variable. || <@201258476750635008>
what thingy ? || <@236118847373967360>
whatever || <@152842840991465475>
whatbresolution setting ? can you turn on performance overlay to see your fps ? || <@236118847373967360>
check if you have any dumb programs that jump up in network usage in task mgr when you launch games || <@201258476750635008>
but the performance overlay shows high latency on Game || <@236118847373967360>
Network shows normal numbers under 10ms || <@236118847373967360>
outside of when i moved in and out of the first area, where you change weapons and whatnot || <@152842840991465475>

so maybe thats why? || <@152842840991465475>
thats about how my settings look like other than desktop bitrate at 32, vr at 110 and no video buffering enabled || <@152842840991465475>
If you're having issues with Virtual Desktop please do the following:

• Verify that you have the correct version of Virtual Desktop. You should have purchased and installed the OCULUS QUEST STORE version through your headset. The other versions do not work for the Quest.

• Re-install the latest ADB drivers. (https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/)

•  Virtual Desktop must be patched via SideQuest to play PCVR titles. Here is a graphic that points out each step:
https://i.imgur.com/oBA7a4I.png

Quick Summary:
Connect your Quest to PC  > run SideQuest > type Virtual Deskop in the search bar >  press enter > Click on Virtual Desktop VR Patch > Click install to headset> Click the Tasks button on top of window (3 lines with a check mark) Ito be sure it has Transferred successfully! It is a very small patch, it shouldn't take over 30 seconds,.
(Note: this must be done every time the Quest VD updates, even small updates.)

• Use VRP Batmaker to make a working launcher!

More info:
VRP Batmaker has essentially replaced Virtual Desktop Launcher (Virtual Desktop helper app) for the most part., (plus it can be used for OCULUS LINK games now). VDL is still attached but VRP Batmaker is a more permanent solution that we highly recommend. It works the same way as VDL but if you closely follow the tutorial you'll end up with legitimate looking desktop shortcuts that enable your games to properly show up in the headset! || <@201258476750635008>
is what you mean || <@152842840991465475>
